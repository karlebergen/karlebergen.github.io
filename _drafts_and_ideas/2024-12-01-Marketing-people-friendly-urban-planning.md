How I would market a campaign to remove parking spaces. 

It's no secret that pockets of american society is going through a culture shift towards cars. Many people feel too dependent on having a car and needing a car to do normal household chores like buying milk. In addition to that, owning a car can cost up to $5000/year when you consider insurance and gas prices, not to mention repairs, and potential hours of productivity wasted sitting in traffic. 

I relate to these issues extremely well, since I live in Los Angeles (Atwater vilalge), and need to comute to UCLA every day for business school. LA has been extremely car firendly the last 25+ years, which we can see because of an absence of good public transport. 


At school, I've gotten very interested in marketing, and I thought, "how would I market ideas to not build for cars?". Simple enough, I will be making posters, these posters need to communicate the following. 


It's not that I want less cars on the road, I just want people to use them when all other options take 1.5x longer.
