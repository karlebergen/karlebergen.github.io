What's important for marketing?


Know your customer. I've developed a game for myself called, the customer is smart, but the customer is also dumb. It goes like this, you think about a product you are trying to sell, and you put yourself in the sales situation/marketing situation. You then need to give yourself a reason why the customer is smart and why the customer is dumb.

- Add, everyone is dumb at some point. We have all walked into a room without remembering why we needed to be there right?
- Add, everyone is smart (I hope). At leas to the point where they can read and compare things with their own experiences.

The customer is smart,
- Think about certain IT solutions. Customer is usually asking for specific functionalities, they know what they want.

But the customer is also dumb
- If you offer a $25 off if they renew they may actually renew, when $25 is only 0.1% of the price.
