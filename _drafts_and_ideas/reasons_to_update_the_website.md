Why this is a better website.

1. Your current website is not mobile friendly.
2. It is super outdated. (but you know that?)
	- So how are you gonna fix it?
	- You should probably show projects/ideas that are business related.
	- I personally believe that if someone looks at your current website, they won't know how to get a quick overview of you/who you are and what you are interested in.
	- If you have a couple of blog posts, the titles alone (assuming the are discriptive) can convey a much better sense of who you are and what you like.
3. This website will also let you create a Github Account, which is just good to have to show how you might be tech-savvy. This way you can show programming adjacent things. Or do more public note taking, which can be more public facing
