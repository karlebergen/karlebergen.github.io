Why this is a better website.

1. Your current website is not mobile friendly.

2. It is super outdated. (but you know that?)
	- So how are you gonna fix it?
	- You should probably show projects/ideas that are business related.
	- I personally believe that if someone looks at your current website, they won't know how to get a quick overview of you/who you are and what you are interested in.
	- If you have a couple of blog posts, the titles alone can convey a much better sense of who you are and what you like.
3. This website will also let you create a Github Account, which is just good to have to show how you might be tech-savvy. This way you can show programming adjacent things. Or do more public note taking, which can be more public facing 

You might be thinking, "Yea, but who's gonna see this?". To that I say, if 10% of jobs you apply to look at your resume, than 1/10 people. If no one else who is applying has a website, you already have a leg up. If they see one of your blog posts and like the content, you have a another leg up. The website is 3/5 for you and 2/5 for others. You need to to document your progress, likes/dislikes, ideas about certain things. And whenever you have an interview, you can say, "I've documented some of these ideas on my website." What do you loose? Nothing! If they don't see it, you are in the same position as someone with a resume. If they do see it, it's a win. It's not a business, it a personal thing.
