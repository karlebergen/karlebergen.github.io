Hey, I am Karel Ebergen. I am currently a student at UCLA Business school.

Here are some of my recent works.

# Understudy Youtube Channel

I run a youtube channel where I document the abilities of actors/actresses and why their performances stand out to me. I am the editor, write, produce, and narrator for the series. [Take a look](https://www.youtube.com/@understudy7157)
